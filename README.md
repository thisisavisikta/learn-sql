# SQL Practice Notebook

This repo is like my personal notebook to practise SQL problems from LeetCode. Some queries are AI-assisted when I get stuck, but all are reviewed and understood before adding.
I use comments to explain the logic and help retain what Iâ€™ve learned. It's part of my ongoing effort to improve and get better at SQL.
